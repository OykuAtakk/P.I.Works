# User Interface Specification Document: User Management Screen

## Overview

This document outlines the user interface (UI) specifications for the User Management Screen. The screen allows administrators to manage users within the system, including creating, editing, and enabling/disabling user accounts.

## Initial State

Upon loading the User Management Screen, the interface displays a list of active users in a table format, along with a form on the right-hand side for creating a new user or editing an existing user. The page is designed to be intuitive, providing clear options for managing user accounts.

### Default UI Components

1.  **User List Table**
    
    -   **Columns:**
        
        -   `ID`: Unique identifier for the user (integer, auto-incremented).
        -   `User Name`: The username of the user (string).
        -   `Email`: The email address associated with the user (string).
        -   `Enabled`: A boolean indicator showing whether the user account is active (`true`) or inactive (`false`).
    -   **Functionalities:**
        
        -   Sorting: Users can sort by any column by clicking the column header.
        -   Filtering: By clicking the filter icon in the column header, users can filter results based on that columnâ€™s values.
2.  **New User / Edit User Form**
    
    -   **Fields:**
        
        -   `Username`: Text input for the user's username (required).
        -   `Display Name`: Text input for the user's display name (optional).
        -   `Phone`: Text input for the user's phone number (optional).
        -   `Email`: Text input for the user's email address (required).
        -   `User Roles`: Dropdown menu allowing the selection of one or more roles (e.g., Guest, Admin, SuperAdmin).
        -   `Enabled`: Checkbox indicating whether the user is active. If checked, the user is enabled.
    -   **Buttons:**
        
        -   `Save User`: Saves the current user details to the database. This button is disabled if required fields are not filled.
3.  **Toolbar**
    
    -   `+ New User`: Button that clears the form and prepares it for creating a new user.
    -   `Hide Disabled Users`: Checkbox that, when checked, filters the user list to display only enabled users.
